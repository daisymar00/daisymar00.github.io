Today I worked on creating variables within my html file. I replaced links, images and text with variables. This was a pretty easy WOD, I did struggle with my background image to display but that has been a reoccuring issue anyways. I prepared for this WOD by coding one in a different folder to make sure I could do it quickly on my own.
