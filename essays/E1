For WOD 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3 I created a simple HTML file which had a brief summary of 3 different web browsers. The first version was jsut a html file with images of each logo and a few hyperlinks. 
The next version of the website included a CSS file. I was able to make the website more aesthetically pleasing by using different fonts and font colors. I also changed the background color to ivory so it is easier to look at. I struggled with making the text and image inline with one another, but I was able to move the text up a little bit.
For WOD 3.3 I created a table in CSS and used divs to move the summarys and the logo together. This makes the page look cleaner and more organized. I did struggle with creating a third column but I was able to fix my issue after I looked at other examples online.
